# OP-TEE sanity testsuite
This git contains source code for the test suite (xtest) used to test the
OP-TEE project.

All official OP-TEE documentation has moved to http://optee.readthedocs.io. The
information that used to be here in this git can be found under [optee_test].

THIS IS A DUMMY COMMIT JUST TO TEST THE GP enablement at IBART. Do not review,
do not merge.
